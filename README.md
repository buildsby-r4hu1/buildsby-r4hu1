## About Me

- 🏨 Currently at NIT Silchar, CSE 2028.
- 🧩 Exploring AI/ML and UI/UX.
- 😭 I'm not afraid of death, but people using light mode.
- 🗨️ I probably hate myself more than I hate you, so don't hesitate to ask me.
- 😅 I'll ChatGPT it and tell you.
- 🤕 Will update Readme.md later, and include other realavant stuff.
